      <h2>Early Life & Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in the small village of Golagodu, Samartha GS (widely known as <strong>Epic</strong> or <strong>Sammu</strong>) 
        discovered his passion for technology at a very young age. His curiosity for how things work led him to dismantle 
        household gadgets and rebuild them with creative twists. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he dived deep into IoT 
        (Internet of Things), completing over 50+ projects ranging from smart home systems to AI-powered automation tools. 
      </p>
      <p>
        He credits much of his inspiration to his sister, <strong>Supriya Bhatt GS</strong>, who encouraged him to take risks, 
        learn coding, and apply his knowledge in meaningful ways. This support ignited his transition from hardware tinkering 
        to professional-level software development.

        Samartha started his web journey in 2021 with a basic Blogspot site. From there, he taught himself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
        and gradually began creating calculators, timers, and utility-based apps. With persistence, he moved on to advanced 
        development such as PHP-based apps, full-stack games, and cloud-integrated platforms.
      </p>

        His progress was shared with his peers and family, earning appreciation for his consistency and creativity. By 2022, 
        he launched his portfolio website and began building software solutions for practical use.
